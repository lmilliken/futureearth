<div>Limiting global average temperature below 2 &deg;C translates to a cumulative carbon budget of approximately 2,895 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (GtCO2), or 2,162 GtCO2 for 1.5 &deg;C. By 2015, past emissions amounted to 2,052 GtCO2. This leaves a remaining budget of approximately 843 GtCO2 for just a 66% probability of remaining below 2 &deg;C, or 110 GtCO2 to reach 1.5 &deg;C with the same probability. This further translates to approximately 20 years of emissions at rates similar to today (around 40 GtCO2 annually) for a 2 &deg;C target. For the 1.5 &deg;C goal, the budget will be extinguished before 202039.&nbsp;</div><div>To substantially reduce the risk of global average temperature rising by 2 &deg;C, global emissions&nbsp; should peak no later than 2020 and approach net zero by 2050-2060. This must also be done in concert with halting deforestation, turning agriculture from carbon source to carbon sink, and protecting existing carbon sinks on ocean and land. Pursuing efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 &deg;C is likely to require untried industrial-scale deployment of carbon capture and storage solutions in addition to reducing emissions to approximately zero by 2050-206040. Delaying large-scale emissions reductions by a decade makes the Paris goal almost unattainable41. As a simple rule of thumb, if nations and non-state actors (businesses, cities, etc) set goals to halve their emissions every decade, the world would have a stronger chance of achieving the Paris Agreement42.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Progress is being made. Between 2014 and 2016, there was almost no growth in the magnitude of annual CO2 emissions43, largely due to significant efforts in China. For over a decade, renewable energy expansion around the globe has grown at an exponential rate, doubling around every 5.5 years. This exponential trajectory is consistent with complete decarbonisation of the energy sector by mid-century44. But emissions are projected to rise again on 2017. This is concerning.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div><div><div>Figure 8. Top: a representative pathway to stabilise global average temperature at around 1.5 &deg;C with 50% probability. Such pathways assume large-scale &quot;negative emissions&quot; to achieve this goal, which have been untried at scale. Middle: a rule of thumb of halving emissions every decade is consistent with the Paris Agreement. Bottom: renewable energy&#39;s share of primary energy is growing exponentially &ndash; doubling around every 5-6 years, albeit from a very low baseline. This exponential trajectory is consistent with Paris Agreement goals (Rockstr√∂m et al. 2017)</div>

Humanitarian, social and economic impacts due to environmental stresses and extreme events. People have always been exposed to extreme events, but these events are likely to change in frequency and intensity in a warmer world. Plus, populations and infrastructure are expanding in vulnerable areas. This often occurs without adequate planning for large-scale shocks and ongoing incremental change .</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div></div><div>&nbsp;</div>
