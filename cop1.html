		<div><strong>Evidence shows that Earth has entered a new geological epoch &ndash; the Anthropocene &ndash; with profound implications for humanity and the relative stability of the Earth system.&nbsp;</strong></div>

		<div>&nbsp;</div>
		<div>A defining characteristic of the last 11,000 years, a period in Earth history geologists call the Holocene, has been global climatic stability. Global average surface temperature, for example, has fluctuated plus or minus 1 &deg;C3. Agriculture and our advanced civilisation emerged against the backdrop of this relatively stable climate.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Evidence from many lines of inquiry now indicates that human influence is so substantial that Earth is no longer in the Holocene, but rather in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene4. Evidence ranges from rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, biodiversity loss, and alterations to the carbon, water, and nitrogen cycles.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The land and oceans absorb approximately 50% of human-induced CO2 emissions. So far, despite an exponential rise in human pressures since the 1940s-1950s, these sinks have moderated human influence on the climate. Deforestation and agriculture are weakening land carbon sinks.&nbsp;</div><div>2015 and 2016 saw record increases in the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 due to CO2 emissions and a weaker carbon sink on land in response to El Niño. El Niño is now over but the 2017 projection for atmospheric CO2 is above the past decadal average. This is a concern5.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Weakened carbon sinks will hamper efforts to remain below 2 &deg;C6. This suggests that succeeding with the Paris Agreement is closely coupled with succeeding in implementing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which set out a roadmap for a transformation to global sustainability for both people and planet.</div>

		<div><div><strong>Earth is approaching tipping points due to human pressures.</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We should not expect climate change to happen incrementally. In the past, large parts of the Earth system, such as ice sheets, rainforests, and oceans, have shifted abruptly following long periods of incremental change7. Expected future abrupt changes might cross thresholds or tipping points that may be irreversible and may have large negative implications for human populations. Research suggests three temperature ranges of concern for tipping points8:</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Tipping elements that may be crossed at a&nbsp; 1-3 &deg;C rise in global average surface temperature (note: these levels are within the range of the Paris Agreement targets)</em></div><ul><li>Loss of Arctic summer sea ice</li><li>Irreversible melting of parts of the Greenland Ice Sheet</li><li>Irreversible melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet</li><li>Loss of many warm-water coral reefs</li><li>Disappearance of many mountain glaciers</li></ul><div><em>Tipping elements that may be crossed at 3-5 &deg;C</em></div><ul><li>Significant parts of the Amazon shift from rainforest to savanna</li><li>Boreal foresst: large-scale ecological and shifts affecting regional warming</li><li>Influence on the thermohaline circulation, in particular slowdown of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation</li><li>Changes to strength and frequency of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation</li><li>Greening of the Sahel&nbsp;</li></ul><div><em>Tipping elements likely beyond 5 &deg;C&nbsp;</em></div><ul><li>Irreversible melting of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet</li><li>Melting permafrost and release of methane&nbsp;</li><li>Loss of Arctic winter sea ice</li></ul>

		<div><strong>Risks of extreme weather are increasing.</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The record-breaking 2017 Atlantic hurricane season9 is a glimpse into the changing risks of the Anthropocene. Energy is accumulating in the oceans and atmosphere as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions10 and the associated global warming. The increasing energy is amplifying the hydrological cycle and influencing tropical storms by supplying them with more energy. These increasing environmental pressures are further exacerbated by urban development, which is intensifying in vulnerable regions such as flood zones.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Long-term observations suggest that heatwaves have become more frequent in the last 50 years in large parts of Europe, Asia, and Australia11. It is also likely that the numbers of extreme rainfall events over land have increased in many regions over the past few decades12, most markedly in Southeast Asia (+ 50%) but also in Europe (+ 30%)13. The rise in extreme weather events, already at 1.1 &deg;C global warming, have significant social and economic implications with rising mortality levels due to heatwaves (see statement 6 below). Weather-related disasters may affect two-thirds of the European population by 2100 compared with 5% in 1980-2010 under business as usual conditions14.</div><div>&nbsp;</div>

The resulting warmer waters expand causing sea levels to rise. Melting glaciers and ice sheets also contribute to sea-level rise. Sea levels will continue to rise while greenhouse gas emissions continue, and levels will not stabilise until centuries after stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions16.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>By the end of the century, global average sea levels are projected to rise about one metre, presenting substantial challenges for coastal protection in places ranging from Florida to Bangladesh17. If emissions continue unabated, meltwater from Greenland and Antarctica will, eventually, dominate sea-level rise. These ice sheets are estimated to lead to more than two metres of sea-level rise per degree of global warming18.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>Ocean acidification&nbsp;</em></div><div>Ocean uptake of CO2 from emissions from human activities is causing the chemistry of the oceans to change. Ocean acidification is occurring at unprecedented rates. The last time the pace of ocean acidification came close to current rates was 56 million years ago and coincided with very significant changes in ocean ecosystems that have been described as a major extinction. Ocean acidification is progressing faster today by an order of magnitude than it did at that time19. Scientists are already seeing negative effects of ocean acidification on food webs. However, it is an open research question how ocean acidification will, ultimately, affect food webs, starting with plankton, the basis of life in the sea20.</div>
